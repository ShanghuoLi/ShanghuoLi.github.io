I'm a PhD student at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Dr. Junzhi Wang and Dr. Qizhou Zhang.
I also worked as an SMA pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, supervised by Dr. Qizhou Zhang, in 2017-2019. I will get my PhD degree at the end of 2019.

My research interests is focused on molecular cloud, star and cluster formation, Filament and turbulence. During the period of my PhD, I have used radio, millimeter and sub-millimeter data from, e.g., ALMA, SMA, NOEMA, JVLA, IRAM 30m, JCMT, SMT, KP 12m, CSO, PMO 13.7m, KVN 21m and Tianma 65m, to study the molecular clouds from large scale > 1 pc down to small scale <0.1 pc.
